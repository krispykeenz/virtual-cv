# Project Image Placeholders

To add the required project images, you can:

1. **Use these placeholder URLs in the projects component:**
   - Replace `assets/images/project-ecommerce.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=1`
   - Replace `assets/images/project-taskmanager.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=2`
   - Replace `assets/images/project-weather.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=3`
   - Replace `assets/images/project-api.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=4`
   - Replace `assets/images/project-social.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=5`
   - Replace `assets/images/project-mobile.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=6`

2. **Or add actual project screenshots:**
   - Save your project images in this directory with the exact filenames listed above
   - Recommended size: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio
   - Format: JPG or PNG

3. **For the profile image:**
   - Add `profile.jpg` to this directory
   - Recommended size: 400x400px (square aspect ratio)
   - This will replace the placeholder in the About component
